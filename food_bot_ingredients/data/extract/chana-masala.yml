    - Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add [oil](ingredient), [onion](ingredient), [cumin](ingredient), and one-third of the [salt](ingredient) (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
      Add [garlic](ingredient), [ginger](ingredient), [cilantro](ingredient), and [green chilies](ingredient) to a mortar and pestle and grind into a rough paste (or use a small food processor to pulse into a paste. Alternatively, just finely mince.) Then, add to the pan with the onions.
      Next add ground [coriander](ingredient), [chili powder](ingredient), and [turmeric](ingredient) and stir to coat. Add a little more [oil](ingredient) at this point if the pan is looking dry.
      Next add pureed [tomatoes](ingredient) and [chickpeas](ingredient) and remaining [salt](ingredient) (1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup (240 ml) [water](ingredient) (I added ~1/2 cup (120 ml) // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You’re looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew.
      Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.
      In the meantime, if you don’t have garam masala seasoning, make your own by adding (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) 2 small dried [red chilies](ingredient), 1 tsp [black peppercorns](ingredient) (or 1/2 tsp [ground black pepper](ingredient)), 1 tsp [cumin seeds](ingredient) (or 1/2 tsp [ground cumin](ingredient)), 1 tsp [cardamom pods](ingredient) (or 1/2 tsp [ground cardamom](ingredient)), 1/2 tsp [cloves](ingredient) (or 1/4 tsp [ground cloves](ingredient)), and 1/8 tsp [nutmeg](ingredient) to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind/mix into a powder. Set aside.
      When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more [salt](ingredient) for saltiness, [chili powder](ingredient) for heat, or a bit of [coconut sugar](ingredient) for sweetness and to offset the heat of the chilies.
      Remove from heat and add [lemon juice](ingredient) and [garam masala](ingredient). Stir to mix, then let cool slightly before serving. Fresh [cilantro](ingredient) and [lemon juice](ingredient) make an excellent garnish. Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it can be delicious with [white or brown rice](ingredient) (see my favorite method here), or [cauliflower rice](ingredient). Lastly, my favorite is over roasted [sweet potatoes](ingredient) and [broccoli](ingredient) (see notes for instructions).
      Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month.
